    <h3 id="headline">Tragic facts about poor Laika:</h3>
    <ul class="muted-background">
      <li><strong>Laika Was A Stray</strong> - Before the space program, Laika had no home. She was a mongrel dog, found wandering the streets of Moscow.</li>

      <li>
        <strong>They Knew She Would Die</strong> - The satellite they’d built wasn’t equipped for a safe reentry. They knew that she would not survive the trip home.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>She Spent Weeks In Increasingly Smaller Cages</strong> - Sputnik 2 was little bigger than a washing machine. Inside, Laika wouldn’t even have enough space to turn around, and, to make sure she didn’t, she would be chained in a single spot. To prepare her Laika was put into smaller and smaller cages. She would be left locked up in claustrophobic conditions for up to 20 days. Then she’d be put into an even tighter space.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Laika Was Terrified</strong> - Laika wasn’t launched that day. For the next three days, she was grounded inside the spacecraft, waiting on Earth. There had been a malfunction that had to be repaired, and so Laika was kept in freezing cold temperatures, unable to move.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Her Death Was Horrifying</strong> - Laika died within seven hours of blast-off, sometime during her fourth circuit around the Earth, in excruciating pain. She died from overheating and panic. Soviets claimed that Laika survived her first day in space, that she drifted in orbit around the Earth for days. At last, she ate the poisoned food they’d prepared for her and passed peacefully onto the other side with the Earth below her. The truth came out in 2002, 45 years after her fateful mission. 
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>She Disintegrated On Re-Entry</strong> - Laika's "coffin" circled the Earth 2,570 times and burned up in the Earth's atmosphere on 4 April 1958.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Space heroine</strong> - Despite surviving for just a few hours, Laika's place in space history is assured and the information she provided proved that a living organism could tolerate a long time in weightlessness and paved the way for humans in space. Laika invigorated a world’s imagination for space travel. Less than four years after her launch, Yuri Gagarin would become the first man in space, and he would come home safely.

        “The more time passes, the more I’m sorry about it. We shouldn’t have done it. We did not learn enough from the mission to justify the death of the dog.”
